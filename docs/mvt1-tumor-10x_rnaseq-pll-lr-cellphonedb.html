The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

partner average expression values in the corresponding interacting pairs
of cell types. If one of the mean values is 0, then the total mean is

partners. If p.value &lt; 0.05, the value will be the mean.

<p>Plot showing meand and pvalues for all the interaction pairs (y-axis)
that are significant (P&lt;=0.05) in at least one of the samples
(x-axis). Rows are clustering based on means values using euclidean
distance and complete method for agglomeration. Each column represent a

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Table of Results</h3>
<p>In this table we are showing results for interactions involving
cytokine ligands in TME and receptors in the cancer populations. The
analysis is done for each pair of cell type by mpuse and site. List of
cytokine genes was obtained from GO (<a href="GO:0005125"
class="uri">GO:0005125</a>) cytokine activity (<a
href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/vocab/gene_ontology/GO:0005125">definition</a>.</p>
<p>Main column description :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>mean : mean value refers to the total mean of the individual
partner average expression values in the corresponding interacting pairs
of cell types. If one of the mean values is 0, then the total mean is
set to 0</p></li>
<li><p>pvalue : P value refers to the enrichment of the interacting
ligand–receptor pair in each of the interacting pairs of cell
types</p></li>
</ul>
<p>-sigmean: Significant mean calculation for all the interacting
partners. If p.value &lt; 0.05, the value will be the mean.
Alternatively, the value is set to 0</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Table of Results</h3>
<p>In this table we are showing results for interactions involving
cytokine ligands in TME and receptors in the cancer populations. The
analysis is done for each pair of cell type by mpuse and site. List of
cytokine genes was obtained from GO (<a href="GO:0005125"

<p>Main column description :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>mean : mean value refers to the total mean of the individual
partner average expression values in the corresponding interacting pairs
of cell types. If one of the mean values is 0, then the total mean is
set to 0</p></li>
<li><p>pvalue : P value refers to the enrichment of the interacting
ligand–receptor pair in each of the interacting pairs of cell
types</p></li>
</ul>
<p>-sigmean: Significant mean calculation for all the interacting
partners. If p.value &lt; 0.05, the value will be the mean.
Alternatively, the value is set to 0</p>
