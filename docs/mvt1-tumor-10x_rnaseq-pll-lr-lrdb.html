The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> LR database :
SingleCellSignalR</h3>
<p>Database for ligand-receptor interaction was obtained from
SingleCellSignalR, converting human genes to mouse orthologs.</p>
<p>Reference : <a
href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/10/e55/5810485">Cabello-Aguilar,
et al., NAS (2021)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We decided to favor interpretable inferences that are supported by
the literature or experimental data. Accordingly, we compiled the
content of existing databases that contain such LR pairs: FANTOM5 (6),
HPRD (27), HPMR (28), the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to Pharmacology (29) and
UniProtKB/Swissprot (30) annotations related to families of ligands or
receptors covered in the previous databases. We also extracted LR pairs,
with respective participants annotated as ligand or receptor in GO (31),
from Reactome (32) pathways. We required GO Cellular Compartment (GOCC)
annotation ‘receptor complex’ (<a href="GO:0043235"
class="uri">GO:0043235</a>) for receptors, and ‘extracellular space’ (<a
href="GO:0005615" class="uri">GO:0005615</a>) or ‘extracellular region’
(<a href="GO:0005576" class="uri">GO:0005576</a>) for ligands. Reactome
pathways were downloaded from Pathway Commons (33). That yielded 3191
pairs. Inspection of the latter revealed 106 dubious cases,
i.e. ligand–ligand or receptor–receptor, or non-secreted gene products.
After elimination, we obtained 3085 reliable LR pairs, which we extended
with 166 pairs extracted from cellsignaling.com maps and related
literature manually to reach 3251 LR pairs (Figure 1A and B). All the
gene symbols were converted into the latest HUGO version as part of the
curation process.</p>
